## Project Title: Fast, Efficient Search Application with Hono, Redis, and Next.js
This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app, featuring a high-performance search application. The app uses Hono for backend routing, Redis for caching and ranking search terms, and Next.js for building the modern frontend UI.

Key Features:
- Hono Backend: A lightweight and fast backend using Hono to handle user search queries.
- Redis Caching: Search terms are cached and ranked using Redis to provide fast response times.
- Next.js Frontend: The frontend is built with Next.js, offering a responsive and optimized user interface.
- Edge Deployment Ready: The app is optimized for deployment on platforms like Vercel, ensuring low-latency performance.
